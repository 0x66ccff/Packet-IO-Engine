# Packet I/O Engine

Packet I/O Engine is a high-performance batching-oriented device driver for Intel 82598/82599-based network interface cards.
This program is based on Intel IXGBE driver (version 2.0.38.2), but heavily modified for throughput-oriented user-level applications.
The modifications include batch processing, huge packet buffer, aggressive software prefetch, etc.
